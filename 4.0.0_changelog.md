Breaking Changes
----------------
* Drop support for python 2

* Depreciated warnings have been removed and are now errors:
    - Support for `JWT_CSRF_HEADER_NAME` config option is removed
    - `jwt.expired_token_loader` callback will error if it does not take an argument
      for the expired token
    - `jwt.decode_key_loader` callback will error if it does not take an argument
      for the unverified_claims and the unverified_headers

* All view decorators have been moved under a single method:
    - `@jwt_required` is now `@jwt_required()`
    - `@jwt_optional` is now `@jwt_required(optional=True)`
    - `@fresh_jwt_required` is now `@jwt_required(fresh=True)`
    - `@jwt_refresh_token_required` is now `@jwt_required(refresh=True)`
    - `verify_jwt_in_request_optional` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(optional=True)`
    - `verify_jwt_refresh_token_in_request` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(refresh=True)`
    - `verify_fresh_jwt_in_request` is now `verify_jwt_in_request(fresh=True)`

* The default JWT_IDENTITY_CLAIM is now `sub` instead of `identity`

New Things
----------
* To simplify conformance to our styleguide, we are formatting all our code with
  black (https://github.com/psf/black). Any code formatted incorrectly will
  cause an error on a `tox` or travis-ci run.

TODO
----
* Put all claims at the top level, instead of user claims in a separate key. Allows
  greater flexability for things like modifing exp times, changing issuers, etc as
  needed for a given application

* Make CSRF_ENABLED true by default. Update documentation accordingly

* A good way to have multiple tokens in the same request? Think on that more.

* Don't rely on `get_raw_jwt` (et al) in error callback functions. Instead, pass
  the entire contents of the token to the callback functions as needed. Less global
  state.

* Have tox do a flake8 test, instead of relying on the pull request integration
  thing we currently have setup.

* Add support for pypy3

* Finish dropping support for python2

* Remove pep8speaks plugin from repo in favor of black

* Update documentation for all the things
